Repository for the Magdalen College School robotics team.

Founded in September 2023, we entered the PiWars International Robotics Competition, which took place on April 20th at the William Gates Building in Cambridge. 
We took home first place. The code for the competition can be found in the /piwars/ folder. 

Our entry to ROBOCON 2025 ended with us winning the award for Best Engineering Innovation, missing out on the win due to bad luck with our robot getting stuck with another one. 
Code files (not up to date) and some CAD files can be found in the ROBOCON folder

2025/2026 sees us enter for the first time the FIRST Tech Challenge, a hugely exciting opportunity having secured the funding for it. Progress will be updated here and on our Makerspace page.
