Repository for the MCS robotics team.

Founded in September 2023, we entered the PiWars International Robotics Competition, which took place on April 20th at the William Gates Building in Cambridge. 
We took home first place. The code for the competition can be found in the /piwars/ folder. 

Files with more obscure names were named because of the names of the challenges set by the competition (more info in the files)
